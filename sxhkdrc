#  This setup assigns keyboard shortcuts to desktops,  #
#  however, it also swiches the "normal"               #
#  keyboard-desktop association, such that,            #
#  shortcut 8 accesses desktop 10 and                  #
#  shortcut 0 accesses desktop 8                       #
#  This is a way to achieve the folloing setup         #
#  (as persived by user)                               #
